              <h3>Why?</h3>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Things we already know</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>ESD can damage equipment</li>
                  <li>(Strong) ESD can damage people</li>
                  <li>The job of electronics is to control electricity with conductive material, and comopnents, some of which aren't tolerant of excessive ESD</li>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Things you may not have known</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>Electricty, and charge in general, exists in a <em>field</em>, similar to how we feel gravity in a field, depending on our distance from the Earth</li>
                  <li>ESD is just electrons rapidly moving toward the field they feel</li>
                  <li>Anything inside an ESD Bag doesn't feel the changes in an ambient electric field outside the bag</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How?</h2>
              <br />
              <h3>ESD Bags are a <em>Faraday Cage</em></h3>
          </section>
          <section data-background-image="./images/faraday-cage.jpg" style="color: #fff">
              <h2>What?</h2>
              <br />
              <p>Michael Faraday (the unit Farad was named after him, the unit of Capacitance)</p>
              <p>People within it would never be shocked, when sparks flew around it</p>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Explanation</h2>
              <p>As we learned from BEC, a change in electric field creates a magnetic flux, which in turn creates another electric field. This is called an "eddy current"</p>
              <img src="./images/eddy-current.jpeg" />
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Explanation</h2>
              <p>As more eddy currents are created, more fields are created, and thus more eddy currents - the electric field is distributed along the surface.</p>
              <p>When the surface is a convex shape (i.e., a bag) a conductor, the electric potential (voltage) distributed across the surface of the shape. The shape is an <em>equipotential</em> in the electric field.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Examples</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>RF / Coax cables</li>
                  <li>Microwave</li>
                  <li>Cars</li>
                  <li>Elevators</li>
                  <li>ESD Bags</li>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>I don't care, get on with it</h2>
              <p>ESD Bags prevent electrostatic fields from forming inside the bag</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Always</strong> use an ESD bag when moving or storing components</li>
                  <li>You can make your own bags with the heat-sealer in the Micro-Min shop, if you need to</li>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>More Precautions</h2>
              <p>At some point, a component will be removed from a bag. What else should be considered?</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The air can be electrically charged - humid or dusty air is bad (clouds and volcanos are examples)</li>
                  <li>Your clothes get charged when you walk or contact other fabric - clothes out the dryer</li>
                  <li>Your skin is electrically charged - your heard and muscles depend on it to function</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Everything</strong> is electrically charged!</p>

              <h2>So, what do I do?</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Dehumidifiers, A/C, and air filters</h2>
              <br />
              <p>Reduce the chance for static buildup in the air</p>

          <section>
              <h2>Being grounded</h2>
              <br />
              <p>What does it mean to be grounded?</p>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Primer on Voltage</h2>
              <br />
              <p>Voltage measures the difference in charge between two points, with some distance between them.</p>
              <p>This difference also creates a <em>physical force</em> between them; that's why your clothes cling when coming out of the dryer.</p>
              <p>Similar to gravity - instead of mass, it's charge, and instead of weight, it's voltage.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Primar on Voltage</h2>
              <br />
              <p>However, unlike gravity, we can often neutralize an excessive charge.</p>
              <p>What does that mean? We make the charge of some <em>thing</em> the same as everything around it.</p>
              <p>That's why it's called a <em>ground</em>.</p>

              <h4>Grounding yourself and your work space</h4>
              <ul>
                  <li>Use an ESD grounding mat on your work surface, and make sure it's connected to your ground</li>
                  <li>Before removing or handling a circuit card, make sure you are grounded</li>
                  <li>Place your hand on the work surface, on the grounding bar</li>
                  <li>Stay clean</li>
                  <li><strong>Always</strong> wear a grounding strap connected to your ground!</li>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <br />
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Always</strong> use ESD bags when storing or transporting sensitive material</li>
                  <li><strong>Always</strong> keep your work surface clean and dehumidified</li>
                  <li><strong>Always</strong> wear a grounding strap, and make sure it's connected to ground</li>
              </ul>
