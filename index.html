              <h3>History - Civil War</h3>
              <p>Parris Island was harbored to many military settlers since the discovery of the New World -
              originally called "Port Royal", its Sound gave convenient access to the Atlantic and deeper
              inland.</p>
              <p>During the Civil War, the Union Navy converted it from a cotton plantation to a coaling station;
              fueling the Union's maritime force. Two years after the war, the Navy and Army vacated most of the island, leaving a small unit to continue the supply.
              </p>

          <section>
              <h3>History - Marines Arrive</h3>
              <p>In 1890, Navy officials decided to expand the supply and coaling depot to a <i>repair</i>
              facility - the expansion warranted Officer's housing, a Marine barracks, a Hospital, and a
                  water closet (restroom).</p>
              <p>The Marine guard consisted of 1 Sergeant, 2 Corporals, and 10 Privates.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h3>History - Officers' School</h3>
              <p>By 1909, the Marine Barracks at Port Royal became Marine Officers' School, and shortly
                  after, Disciplinary Barracks were created for the Navy; a Prison for criminal Sailors
                  and Marines; guilty of embezzlement, unauthorized absence, and other similar crimes.</p>
              <p>After maintaining good conduct in the prison for a few years, prisoners were given the option
              to re-enlist on probation.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h3>History - Recruit Training</h3>
              <p>In 1911, Commandant Major General William P. Biddle ordered four recruit depots across the
                  United States - Philadelphia, Norfolk, Puget Sound, and Mare Island. The Officers' School was
                  also transferred to Norfolk, and continued to use Port Royal as a disciplinary installation.</p>
              <p>Four years later, however, Norfolk was closed and moved back to Port Royal, for the extra
                  space, dismantling the prison in the process. As the United States entered WWI, recruits
                  surged from 835 on average, to a peak of 13,286.
              </p>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h3>Birth of the Depot</h3>
              <p>WWI demanded a large expansion from Port Royal, and it was during this time that MCO No. 32
                  ordered the redesignation of Marine Barracks, Port Royal to Marine Barracks, Parris Island.</p>
              <p>The name "Parris Island" has an origin from before the Constitutional United States - it
                  is named after a treasurer, Col. Alexander Parris, who long ago purchased the island in 1715.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h3>History - WWI and WWII</h3>
              <p>More than 46,000 Marines were trained for duty for WWI. For WWII, over 200,000 Recruits became
                  Marines, in over 13 recruit training battalions.</p>
              <p>Shortly after the second world war, the 3th recruit training battalion was activated for
                  training Female Marines (later redesignated as 4th RTBn), and likewise the African-Americans
              trained at Montford Point were integrated into the depot.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h3>Implications</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>The large influx of recruits for WWI caused a new rank to be made - Private First Class.</li>
                  <li>The Drill Instructor billet was created at the same time, as was Drill Instructor School.</li>
                  <li>Standardized the requirements of being a Marine.</li>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>Parris Island was the first large-scale Recruit Depot for the Marine Corps; without it, we wouldn't have the same level of discipline, motivation, or leadership that we do today.</p>
